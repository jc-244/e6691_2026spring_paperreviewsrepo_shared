# e6691_2026spring_paperreviewsrepo_shared

This repo is used to share code and other information relevant to student topic/paper presentations for the course on Advanced Deep Learning in the 202x semester.
* Students should add new directories (if their topic does not have the directory yet)
   - Naming of repos should be descriptive
* Students should upload code relevant to their topic/paper presentations
  - The code should be able to run
  - If the size of data is too large, uploading to GitHub should be avoided - the data should be saved and accessible via a link to the student's liondrive (make sure that sharing is enabled)
* Jupyter notebooks are particularly useful for demonstrations
* This repo is to be used together with student paper presentations (Google Slides) located in E6691.20XXspring.studentProjectsAndPapers  in LionDrive
